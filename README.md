TODO

Make current structs private and reify shitty parsing result into something less awful for the public API

Add golang cassowary implementation (https://github.com/lithdew/casso)
Design API for accessing parsed program attributes

DONE
Move parser out of internal you dimwit
Move parser into module
Wrap participle in parser type with functional options pattern
 - Lookahead length
Move test cases to actual test file

WONTFIX
IN PROGRESS - figure out how to use either Capture interface or Parseable to, e.g. parse connections into something not totally idiotic. Probably Parseable tbh
